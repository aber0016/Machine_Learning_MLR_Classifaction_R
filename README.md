# Machine_Learning_MLR_Classifaction

This project uses two supervised machine learning algorithms, multilinear regression and classification, to make a series of predictions. Multilinear Regression was used to predict a cars fuel efficiency. Classification was used to predict whether someone is wealthy or not based on various socio-economic factors.

The training data used for these models are:
- 
- 

Perfromance of both models was measured using
